# AI Features

Quail provides a variety of AI features to help authors. These features are available in the web version, and some of them are also available in the Obsidian plugin.

At present, all AI features are provided by OpenAI's LLM models. You must agree to [OpenAI's terms of service](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/) before using these features.

## Generate Post Link Slug

Slug is the unique identifier of a post. For example, the slug of the post "[ðŸšš How to integrate Discord with your Newsletter by Quail](https://quail.ink/blog/p/how-to-integrate-discord-with-your-newsletter-by-quail)" is `how-to-integrate-discord-with-your-newsletter-by-quail`, which is a semantic interpretation of the title.

A good post slug helps readers and search engines understand the post. If you don't manually enter a slug when saving a post, Quail will generate a semantic slug for you.

## Generate Post Metadata

Quail can generate post metadata for you, including:

- post summary
- post tags

To generate them, you can select "Generate Meta" in the Post Menu. After a few seconds, Quail will generate the metadata.

Post Slug is also can be generated. Click the generate button at the right of the slug input box, Quail will generate a slug for you.

## Generate Tweet Thread

Tweet Thread is a feature that allows you to post a series of tweets on X (former name: Twitter).

In Quail, you can use AI to generate a tweet thread from a post. To do this, you can select "Generate Tweet Thread" in the Post Menu. It will pop up a dialog, to ask you to confirm before generating.

When the generation is complete, Quail will show you the generated tweet thread. You can copy it to the clipboard and post it on X, or other social media.

## Translator

To use the Translator feature, you need to open the [Quail Expansion Panel](https://quail.ink/blog/p/better-writing-experiences), and select the "Translator" feature.

## Writer (Beta)

Quail provides a "Writer" feature, which can help authors write.
