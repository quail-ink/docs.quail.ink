# Analytics

## Built-in Analytics

Quail provides simple built-in analytics out of the box. You don't need to configure anything to use it.

For each post, the analytics metrics include:

1. Page views: how many times the post has been viewed (including the webpages and the email).
2. Post reads: how many times the post has been read. A post is considered read when the user stays on the post for more than 10 seconds.
3. Email reads: how many times the post has been read in the email. This metric is only available when you send the post via email.

## 3rd Party Analytics

Quail supports 3rd party analytics services: [Umami.is](https://umami.is/) and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).

### Umami.is 

Umami is an open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. 

At present, Quail only supports the cloud version of Umami. You can sign up for an account on [Umami.is](https://umami.is/), and then enter the `Website ID` in the Quail's Analytics settings.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a popular analytics service. Similar to Umami, you need to sign up for an account on [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), and then enter the `Measurement Id` in the Quail's Analytics settings.
