## Taxes

Quail operates in Japan and complies with Japanese tax laws. For more information on the tax information mentioned below, please visit the official website of the [National Tax Agency](https://www.nta.go.jp).

### Japanese Consumption Tax(JCT)

According to Japanese tax law, Quail is required to collect consumption tax from all order buyers. The tax rate is 10%.

For example, if a reader purchases an article priced at 1000 JPY, Quail will collect 100 JPY in consumption tax from the reader, making the actual payment 1100 JPY.

The JCT may affect readers' purchasing decisions, so authors are advised to consider the JCT when setting prices.

### Withholding Tax

Withholding tax, is a tax that is deducted at the source of income before it is paid to the recipient.

In Japan, this tax applies to various forms of income, including earnings from premium newsletters. The primary purpose of this tax is to ensure that the government receives tax revenue directly when individuals and businesses receive their earnings.

The withholding tax rate varies based on the residency status of the recipient. Japanese residents face a tax rate of 10.21%, while non-Japanese residents are subject to a rate of 20.42%.

### Example

Here is an example of how Quail calculates and pays out earnings (Assuming the author is a Japanese resident and Stripe does not charge additional fees):

- An author earns 10,000 JPY in January, which includes an order of 2,000 JPY and an order of 8,000 JPY.
- These 2 orders' JCT is 200 JPY and 800 JPY, respectively. Therefore, Quail actually receives 11,000 JPY.
- Stripe charges a 3.6% fee and accompanying consumption tax, which will be about `11,000×3.6%×1.1 = 396` JPY.
- Quail will charge a 10% service fee (with 10% JCT), which will be about `10,000×10%×110% = 1,100` JPY.
- The author's revenue is `11000-1100-436-1000=8464` JPY.
- The withholding tax is 10.21% of the author's revenue, which is `8464×0.1021=864` JPY.
- The author's revenue after withholding tax is `8464-864=7600` JPY.

Quail will transfer the 7600 JPY to the author's account next month. According to selected payout method, it may charge additional fees.
