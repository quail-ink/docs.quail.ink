# Obsidian Plugin

**[Quail](https://quail.ink "Quail Official Website")** provides an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that allows you to use Quail's publishing, unpublishing, and post delivering features within Obsidian.

Combined with Obsidian's powerful Markdown editing capabilities, Quail's Obsidian plugin can help you better manage your posts.

## Obtaining an API Key

Quail's Obsidian plugin requires an API key to access Quail's API. Follow these steps to obtain an API key:

1. Log in to Quail: https://quail.ink/login
2. Visit the "[Profile - API Keys](https://quail.ink/dashboard/profile/apikeys)" page.
3. Click the "New" button, enter an API key name, and click "Create".
4. A newly created API key will appear in the API key list. Click the "Copy" button to copy the API key to your clipboard.

Please keep the API key in a secure place and do not share it with others. We will use this API key to configure the Obsidian plugin later.

## Installing the Plugin

Currently, Quail's Obsidian plugin cannot be found in the Obsidian plugin marketplace, so you need to manually install the plugin. Please refer to the [plugin homepage](https://github.com/lyricat/obsidian-quail) for installation instructions.

## Configuring the Plugin

After installing the plugin, you need to configure it to use the functionality provided by the plugin.

1. First, open Obsidian's settings page and click on the "Community Plugins" tab. Find the Quail plugin and click the "Settings" button.
2. Enter the API key you obtained earlier in the "Quail API Key" field.
3. Enter your list slug in the "List ID or slug" field. For example, if your list URL is `https://quail.ink/smith`, then your list slug is `smith`.
4. Keep the other settings at their default values.

Restart Obsidian for the plugin to take effect.

## Writing Posts

You can write posts in Obsidian as usual. Once you have finished writing an post, you can use Quail's Obsidian plugin to publish it.

Before publishing, you need to generate summaries for your posts according to Quail's requirements.

## Generating Summaries and Metadata

Quail provides the functionality to generate post summaries using AI. You can use Quail's Obsidian plugin to invoke this feature. Here's how:

1. Press the shortcut key `Ctrl + P` to open Obsidian's command palette (or `Cmd + P` for macOS users).
2. Type "Quail" and select the "Quail: Generate Metadata" command, then press Enter.
3. Wait a moment, and Quail will automatically generate the summary, tags, and other metadata for your post. It will insert them at the beginning of the post in [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) format.

You will see something similar to the following at the beginning of your post:

```yaml
---
slug: "post-slug"
datetime: 2021-08-01T00:00:00+08:00
summary: "post summary"
tags: "tag1, tag2"
cover: "URL of post cover image"
---
```

In the above frontmatter:

- `slug` is the slug of the post, which Quail uses to generate the post's URL. This slug should be unique within the entire list and generally consists of English words representing the post's title. You can manually modify this slug if you don't want to use the generated one.
- `datetime` is the publication date of the post.
- `summary` is the summary of the post, which you can

 also manually modify.
- `tags` are the post's tags, which you can also manually modify.
- `cover` is the URL of the post's cover image, which you can manually modify. However, when modifying it, please note that:
  1. The cover image must be publicly accessible, or
  2. The cover image must be an image from your Obsidian and use an absolute path. Please refer to the "Inserting Images" section below.

::: tip
You can also choose to manually enter the summary instead of using the AI-generated one.

If you don't want to use the AI-generated summary, you can select the "Quail: Insert Metadata Template" command, and Obsidian will automatically insert a metadata template for you to manually enter the information.

## Saving posts

Once you have finished writing and generating summaries and metadata for your posts, you can use Quail's Obsidian plugin to save them:

1. Press the shortcut key `Ctrl + P` to open Obsidian's command palette (or `Cmd + P` for macOS users).
2. Type "Quail" and select the "Quail: Save" command, then press Enter.
3. Wait a moment, and Quail will automatically save the post to Quail.

If you log in to Quail at this point, you will be able to see the post you just saved in the "[post List](https://quail.ink/dashboard)".

## Publishing posts

Publishing an post changes its status from "Draft" to "Published," making it visible to others:

1. Press the shortcut key `Ctrl + P` to open Obsidian's command palette (or `Cmd + P` for macOS users).
2. Type "Quail" and select the "Quail: Publish" command, then press Enter.
3. Wait a moment, and Quail will automatically publish the post to Quail and display the post's access URL.
4. You can click on the displayed URL to view your post.

## Unpublishing posts

Unpublishing an post changes its status from "Published" to "Draft," making it no longer visible to others.

The process is similar to publishing an post, but in the second step, select the "Quail: Unpublish" command.

## Delivering posts

Delivering an post sends it via email to your subscribers. If you have set up a Telegram bot for your list, the bot will also automatically push the post to your Telegram channel.

The process is similar to publishing an post, but in the second step, select the "Quail: Deliver" command.

## Inserting Images

If the images in your post come from your local Obsidian, Quail's Obsidian plugin can read them and automatically upload them to Quail when saving or publishing posts. However, this requires meeting two requirements:

1. When inserting your images in the post, use Markdown image syntax instead of Obsidian's internal link syntax.
2. Use absolute pathing for the images.

Here's an example:

Suppose your Obsidian directory structure is as follows:

```
- [essay]
  - [images]
    - image-1.png
    - image-2.png
  - [posts]
    - test
```

Here, "essay," "images," and "posts" are folders, "image-1.png" and "image-2.png" are image files, and "test" is an post file.

If you want to insert the image "image-1.png" into "test," you need to use the following syntax:

```markdown
![image-1](/essay/images/image-1.png)
```

Instead of Obsidian syntax:

```markdown
![[image-1]]
```

Note that "/essay/images/image-1.png" is an absolute path (starting from the top-level folder), not a relative path. If you use a relative path, Quail's Obsidian plugin will not be able to locate the image file.
