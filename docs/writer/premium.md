# Premium Subscription

## What is a Premium Subscription?

A premium subscription is a model in which subscribers pay to access an author's content. On Quail, authors can earn revenue by publishing paid articles, columns, courses, and other forms of content.

## Two Premium Subscription Payment Models

### Quail-Hosted Payment

In the Quail-hosted payment model, Quail is responsible for the sale of content goods, collection, invoices, refunds, tax refunds, etc. Authors do not need to worry about tax issues. Quail will handle the corresponding consumption tax at the time of payment and the corresponding withholding tax when paying the author.

In the Quail-hosted payment model, Quail will deduct the following fees from the author's revenue:

1. Platform fee: Quail will deduct a 10% platform fee from the author's revenue.
2. Payment settlement fee: For legal currency payments, Quail uses Stripe to process transactions. Please refer to [Stripe's official website](https://stripe.com/en-jp/pricing) for specific rates.
3. Consumption tax: According to Japanese tax law, Quail needs to collect consumption tax from all order buyers, with a tax rate of 10%.
4. Withholding tax: Withholding tax is a tax deducted from income before it is paid to the recipient. The withholding tax rate varies depending on the recipient's residency status: 10.21% for Japanese residents and 20.42% for non-Japanese residents.

To use the Quail-hosted payment model, you need to:

1. Complete the relevant settings mentioned in [Preparing for Payment](./monetization.md).
2. Set the price in [Payment Settings](./payment-settings).

### Self-Hosted Payment

In the self-hosted payment model, authors need to set up their Stripe account information on Quail. When readers pay authors, they will pay through the Stripe account set up by the author.

Quail is not responsible for the sale of content goods, collection, invoices, refunds, tax refunds, etc. Authors need to handle tax matters according to the requirements of the company or individual's location.

To use the self-hosted payment model, you need to:

1. Complete the relevant settings mentioned in [Preparing for Payment](./monetization.md).
2. Set the price in [Payment Settings](./payment-settings).
3. Enable self-hosted payment in [Payment Settings](./payment-settings).
